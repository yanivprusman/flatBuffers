--js is not supported in flatbuffers.
the documentation says to use --ts and convert to js
this is my 101.fbs file:
namespace MRD;
table MyTable {
    my_ata:string;
}
root_type MyTable;
file_identifier "MRD2";
file_extension "mrd2";
here are the file and folder structure that was generated:
├── output
│   ├── 101.ts
│   ├── mrd
│   │   └── my-table.ts
│   └── mrd.ts
i have a few questions:
for one: why are the file scattered like this?
